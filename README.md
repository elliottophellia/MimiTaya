## 💬 Q&A:
**🤔  Is this detectable?** <br>
**Yes, this is detectable**, it is a user-mode cheat afterall. Although the project may look into the kernel, for now everything is done in user mode. *It is important to note that even if it is detectable, you might not be detected. The cheat uses only RPM by default - with WPM features flagged under "Risky". Other factors such as suspicious gameplay also are important to consider.*<br><br>
**🤔  How can I get support for this software?** <br>
**Feel free to reach out to me personally**, if you have any questions or need help with something related to the software. *My discord username is @Vytrol, I also have a Twitter under the same handle.*<br><br>
**🤔  My antivirus says "X", is this a virus?** <br>
**Of course not.** It wouldn't be the brightest of ideas to open source a virus. You may always build the software yourself if you have concerns with the automatic update system. Why the antivirus flagged the software in the first place could be because of various factors, but likely as this is a cheat.
## 🐛 Known Bugs:
- **⚠️ ESP might not work as expected**, as some players might seem to "teleport" suddenly. I suspect that the data which is being read from the game is sometimes outdated. *Thankfully, this doesn't occur too often - and when it does, it is more times than not the players far away.*
- **⚠️ The FOV circle might flicker from two different sizes**, this happens mostly when a scope is un(equipped) or the scope's zoom is changed. *An easy workaround is to only enable the FOV circle to adjust your FOV, and then promptly disable it.*
- **❓ Something missing?** - If you find a bug, you may open an issue on the repository and it will be added here, the bug may also be fixed in a later update.
