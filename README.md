## 💬 Q&A:
**🤔  Is this detectable?** <br>
**Yes, this may be detectable in certain circumstances**, it is a user-mode cheat afterall. *It is important to note that you might not be detected, other factors such as suspicious gameplay also are important to consider.*<br><br>
**🤔  FPS drops when focusing on the menu, any way to fix that?** <br>
**Yes, there is an actual fix for this.** If you have turned on the developer console, you can simply run the following command to resolve this issue:<br><code>engine_no_focus_sleep 0</code><br><br>
**🤔  My antivirus says "X", is this a virus?** <br>
**Of course not,** it wouldn't be the brightest of ideas to open source a virus - and you can always build the software yourself if you have concerns with the auto-update system. Why the antivirus flagged the software in the first place could be because of various factors, but likely as this is a cheat.
## 🐛 Known Bugs:
- **⚠️ ESP might not work as expected**, as some players might seem to "teleport" suddenly. I suspect that the data which is being read from the game is sometimes outdated. *Thankfully, this doesn't occur too often - and when it does, it is more times than not the players far away.*<br><br>
- **⚠️ The FOV circle might flicker from two different sizes**, this happens mostly when a scope is un(equipped) or the scope's zoom is changed. *An easy workaround is to only enable the FOV circle to adjust your FOV, and then promptly disable it.*<br><br>
- **❓ Something missing?** - If you find a bug, you may open an issue on the repository and it will be added here, the bug may also be fixed in a later update.
